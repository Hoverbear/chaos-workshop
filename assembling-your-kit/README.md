# Assembling Your Kit

We'll use Ubuntu 18.04 for this workshop. It's common and familiar to most users. If your systems uses CentOS or something else, you can do all this as well, you just don't get a premade script. 

If you're just exploring or testing open source code, you can use the provided `terraform` file to bootstrap a node on DigitalOcean. Otherwise, a provisioning script is provided for your own private VM.
