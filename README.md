{% endhint %}

This repository contains the guide and content for the "Surviving Chaos: A Field Guide" workshop hosted at Linux Foundation Open Source Summit 2018 in Vancouver, BC, Canada on August 29-31, 2018.

## Who is this for?

This workshop is targeted towards people who want to:

* Hunt the most obscure and unexpected bugs.
* Improve their testing.
* Build more robust services.
* Find things they overlooked.
* Deploy with more confidence.
* Develop a deeper understanding of the sinister ways computers can fail.
* Sleep soundly at night, without worrying about getting a page.

## What do I need to know?

In order to get the most from this workshop you should be:

* Comfortable navigating a machine via console.
* Able to understand and work with simple `bash` scripts.
* Proficient with editing text on the console.  \(With `nvim`, `emacs`, or whatever\).
* Familiar with some supervisor. \(We'll use `systemd`\)
* Able to write code in some language. \(We'll be using some simple Rust for our demos\)
* Not afraid to kill processes.

Not any of these things? **You can still try,** but you will need to access significant supplementary materials.

## What's Inside?

* This guide.
* A copy of the `reveal.js` slides.
* A `terraform` script to provision a laboratory for you.
* A provisioning `bash` script for Ubuntu 18.04 that sets up all required tools.
* Demo programs to use in your exploration.
